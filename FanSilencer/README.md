# Loud Electronics Bay Fans?
The two Noctua fans that I am using are nice and quiet, until I installed them in my printer. To be more accurate, they were quiet until I mounted the grills in front of them.

I was thinking of not using the fan grills, but decided against this idea because I realized that I needed all the assistance to prevent me from accidentally putting my fingers into the exposed fans...

This also helped with hiding the visible tan color of the Noctua fan bodies, and replaced it with the base color of the printer.

If you don't have M3x35 bolts, simply install four heatsets on both sides of the fan silencer spacer body so that you can mount with shorter bolts.
