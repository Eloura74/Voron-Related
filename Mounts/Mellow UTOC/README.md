# Why pay for an inline fuse?
If you have a couple of spare female spade connectors then there is no need to pay for an inine fuse for your UTOC-1 or UTOC-3.

This simple mount for the Mellow UTOC-1 (or UTOC-3) CAN adapter incorporates a modified version of Erik Cederberg's fuse holder that can be snapped onto the UTOC board mount.
