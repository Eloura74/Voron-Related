# Why pay for an inline fuse holder?
If you have a couple of spare female spade connectors then there is no need to pay for an inine fuse holder for your UTOC-1 or UTOC-3. (I know that you have plenty of wire...)

This simple mount for the Mellow UTOC-1 (or UTOC-3) CAN adapter incorporates a modified version of Erik Cederberg's fuse holder that can be snapped onto the mount for the UTOC board.
